<h2>Brief Summary</h2>
<hr>
<p>
	I received three bachelor's degrees in math, applied math, and statistics from <a href="https://www.csuchico.edu/math/">Chico State University</a> in 2015. I then 
	did a master's degree in applied math
	with a concentration in nonlinear dynamical systems at <a href="https://math.sdsu.edu/">San Diego State University</a> where I studied under <a href="https://jegilles.sdsu.edu/">Jérôme Gilles</a>. 
	My master's thesis was titled "The Empirical Gabor 
	Transform and Empirical Gabor Frames" and I defended it in 2017. After this I went to <a href="https://www.unicaen.fr/">Université de Caen Normandie</a> in the <a href="https://www.greyc.fr/en/equipes/image-2/">GREYC laboratory 
	IMAGE team</a> from 2017-2021 where I did a PhD in math under <a href="https://fadili.users.greyc.fr/">Jalal Fadili</a> and <a href="http://www.gpeyre.com/">Gabriel Peyré</a>. My 
	PhD thesis was titled "First-order noneuclidean splitting methods 
	for large-scale optimization: deterministic and stochastic algorithms". Now I am a postdoc at the <a href="https://www.tse-fr.eu/">Toulouse School of Economics</a> under 
	<a href="https://www.tse-fr.eu/fr/people/jerome-bolte">Jérôme Bolte</a> and <a href="https://www.irit.fr/~Edouard.Pauwels/">Edouard Pauwels</a> since February 2021. Starting in September 2022,
	I will be joining <a href="https://www.universite-paris-saclay.fr/en">Université de Paris-Saclay</a> as an assistant professor.
